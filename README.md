This Django application is designed to process bitmap images of objects, segment them, convert the segmented objects into coordinates, and apply a genetic algorithm for nesting. The primary objective is to efficiently arrange the objects to minimize material waste or optimize space utilization.

### Technologies Used
- **Django**: Framework for building the web application.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing and object segmentation.
- **Shapely**: Library for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects.
- **SVGPathTools**: Library for working with SVG paths, used in converting shapes to coordinates.
